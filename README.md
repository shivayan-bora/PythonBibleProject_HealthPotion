# PythonBibleProject_HealthPotion

This is the first project from the course The Python Bible containing concepts of integers, floating point numbers, arithmetic and random module in the python library.

# Goal:

The value of the health the potion will grant depends on the difficulty of the game i.e. easier difficulty will yeild more health whereas harder difficulty will yeild lesser health.
